Zekun Liu is a PhD candidate from [Prof. Jinyong Liu lab](https://chem-environ.weebly.com/people.html) at [Chemical and Environmental Department](https://www.cee.ucr.edu/) at [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). His research direction is about **water treatment** of [per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)](https://cen.acs.org/sections/pfas.html). With a large collection of more than *150* PFAS structures, he tried to improve the understanding of PFAS structure-reactivity relationships and reaction mechanisms. His goal is to develop a complete treatment strategy, including pre-separation and subsequent destruction to cleave all the C-F bonds in PFAS structures.
