I am a PhD candidate in Prof. Jinyong Liu's lab (https://chem-environ.weebly.com/people.html) at University of California, Riverside (https://www.ucr.edu/). With a large PFAS collection of more than 150 structures, my research focus on
is mainly about the complete defluorination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (https://cen.acs.org/sections/pfas.html) with integrated reduction and oxidation processes.
